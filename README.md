# Climate Data Science

**Welcome!** This repository is a collection of tutorials, with Jupyter Notebooks and Python code, aimed at data analysis and visualization techniques for Climate Science and Earth Observation studies. All the content is produced by me, [Willy Hagi](https://linktr.ee/willyhagi), and the tutorials are planned to be constantly submitted to publication in [Towards Data Science](https://towardsdatascience.com/), known as one of the biggest data science portals of the web.   

For the time, it is possible to run with Google Colab only those Jupyter Notebooks with **Google Earth Engine** code. I hope that some serious Cartopy issues with Colab will be solved soon to allow interaction with the others as well.
